# TNMC
**TNMC** Efficient algorithm design for 2D frusted and disorder system (spin glasses, random bond Ising model)

## Try the code
run the code  by 
```
 julia 2Drun.jl < input
```
where [inpu](src/input) is the parameter entered in the program. The documents of tensor network contraction and sampling are all in [tensor](src/Tensor.jl). 

A lecture has been prepared to help understand the algorithm [lecture](lecture/TNMC.ipynb). Additionally, the associated paper is available at [arXiv.2409.06538](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2409.06538)
