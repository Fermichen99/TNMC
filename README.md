# TNMC
**TNMC** Efficient Algorithm Design for 2D frusted system (spin glasses, random ising model)

## Try the code
run the code  by 
```
 julia 2Drun.jl < input
```
where [inpu](input) is the parameter entered in the program. The documents of tensor network contraction and sampling are all in [tensor](Tensor.jl).
